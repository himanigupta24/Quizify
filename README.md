Quizify aims to develop an engaging quiz website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
React.js, Node.js) that offers a wide range of quizzes across various categories. The objective is
to provide users with an interactive platform to test their knowledge, compete with others, and
discover interesting facts. The project will integrate external APIs to enrich the quiz database
and enhance the user experience, including the implementation of leaderboards to showcase
top performers.
